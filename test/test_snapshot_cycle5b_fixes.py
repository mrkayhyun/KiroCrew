"""Tests for the cycle-5 review findings.

The important one is structural: the authorization used to live in the CLI wrapper, so
anything able to call the library directly could provision and record a destination with
no authorization at all. That is the claim "an agent cannot redirect the backup" failing
a fourth time by a fourth route -- after the registry file, the command that writes it,
and the forgeable TTY gate.
