"""The optional Playwright extension token.

Attaching to the operator's own browser works without this: `playwright-cli`
appends the token to its relay URL only when the environment carries one
(`if (token) url.searchParams.set("token", token)`), and the extension answers a
tokenless handshake by asking the human to approve the connection in the browser.

The token therefore buys exactly one thing -- it removes that approval click --
and costs the two things every stored credential costs: somewhere to keep it, and
a way for a process that should not read it to read it anyway. It is opt-in for
that reason, and absent by default.

**Exposure, stated plainly.** The CLI reads the token from its environment, and the
agent runs the CLI as a shell command, so the value has to be on the environment
of a process the agent's shells descend from. Every command the agent runs can
therefore read it. That is deliberate and is the better of the two available
shapes: the alternative is for the agent to compose the value into a command line
itself, which puts the plaintext into tool-call transcripts and within reach of a
page that talks the agent into echoing it. Here the agent never handles the value.

The blast radius is bounded by what the token authorizes: connecting to the
extension's local relay in a browser already running on this machine. It is not a
cloud credential and grants nothing off-host.
