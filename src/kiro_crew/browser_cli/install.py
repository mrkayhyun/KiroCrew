"""Detection, installation, and the capability gate for ``@playwright/cli``.

The CLI has no capability gating of its own — every command is always available
to whoever can run the binary — so the capability cannot be narrowed after the
fact. **Presence of ``playwright-cli`` is therefore consent**, whichever tool
installed it, and :func:`available` is the whole gate. This module deliberately
holds no toggle, flag, or consent file: a second gate would be a lie, because a
binary on PATH is reachable from any shell turn regardless of what a flag says.

Installation is global (``npm install -g``) rather than ``npx``. ``npx``
re-resolves the package through the registry on every invocation, so an expired
registry token would take browsing down at use time; a global binary resolves
once, at install time, where a failure is visible to the operator.

Node is located through :func:`kiro_crew.env.find_node_tool` rather than bare
``shutil.which``: the gateway can run with a PATH that omits the version-manager
shim directory a global npm install writes into, so a plain PATH lookup misses
a binary that is genuinely present.

Every function here blocks (subprocess, filesystem), so a caller on the event
loop offloads it.
