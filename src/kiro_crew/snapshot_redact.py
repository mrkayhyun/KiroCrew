"""Neutralise credential material in a bundle that is about to leave the host.

An off-host copy crosses a trust boundary the local archive does not: it lands in object
storage, and every principal that can read the bucket can read it. This module rewrites a
STAGED COPY of a bundle so the bytes that leave carry no usable credentials, and it is the
only place in the backup path that does so.

**It is lossy on purpose, and the loss is the point.** A redacted bundle restores to a
working shape but not to a working credential: the token field is present and inert, so the
operator re-enters it rather than discovering an empty file. That tradeoff is a deliberate
product decision, and `backup.redact_uploads` exists to reverse it for an operator who
would rather have a bundle that restores complete.

Two properties make the difference between a redacted bundle and a broken one:

* **Structure survives.** The redactors substitute a tag for a match, so they CHANGE
  LENGTH. Running them over the bytes of a SQLite file does not produce a database with
  dead credentials, it produces a file SQLite cannot open — which the restore path then
  correctly refuses as corrupt. Databases are therefore redacted through SQL, value by
  value, so what is written back is still a database.
* **The bundle says so.** The manifest records that this copy was redacted and what was
  touched, so a restore can tell the operator their credentials are inert instead of
  letting them find out when something fails to authenticate.
